Remaining Steps: {max_step_count - step_count}

Instructions:
1. Analyze the context thoroughly, including the query, its analysis, any image, available tools and their metadata, and previous steps taken.

2. Determine the most appropriate next step by considering:
- Key objectives from the query analysis
- Capabilities of available tools
- Logical progression of problem-solving

* Relevant data from previous steps
* File names or paths created or used in previous steps (list EACH ONE individually)
* Variable names and their values from previous steps' results
* Any other context-specific information required by the tool
